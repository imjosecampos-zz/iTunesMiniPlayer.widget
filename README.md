# iTunesMiniPlayer.widget (not supported anymore)
A widget for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) that let's you see the cover of the song you are listening to, play the next and previous song, and play/pause your music.

To change the position open index.coffee with a text editor and change the lines 6 and 7:
  - To put it on the left top corner set top to 15px and left to 15px.
  - To put it on the right top corner set top to 15px and change left to right keeping the value of 15px.
  - To put it on the left bottom corner set change top to bottom, keeping the value of 15px, and left to 15px.
  - To put it on the right bottom corner change left to right, top to bottom and keep the value of 15px for both.

To change the spacing change the value of 15 to any other.
